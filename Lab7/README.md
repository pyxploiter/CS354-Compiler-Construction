## Basic Syntax Analysis using Bison 

### Introduction
The syntactic or the structural correctness of a program is checked in the syntax analysis phase of compilation. The structural properties of language constructs can be specified in different ways.  Different styles of specifications are useful for different purposes. 

### Objectives
Successful understanding/implementation of Syntax Analysis

### Tools/Software Requirement
1.Flex & Bison on Linux platform

### Lab Tasks
1. simple calculator that recognizes and evaluates binary postfix expressions using a stack e.g. 4 8 +
2. simple calculator that recognizes and evaluates binary infix expressions using a stack e.g. 4 + 8
3. simple calculator that recognizes and evaluates binary prefix expressions using a stack e.g. + 4 8
